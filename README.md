# SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine
Overview
This project is a machine-learning classification task that aims to distinguish between rocks and mines in sonar data. The dataset used for this task is the well-known Sonar dataset, which consists of sonar signals reflected from metal cylinders (mines) and rocks. We will build a binary classification model to predict whether an object is a rock (R) or a mine (M) based on the sonar data.

Dataset
Dataset Name: Sonar dataset
Data Source: The dataset is available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The dataset contains the following attributes:

Feature columns (60): Numerical values representing sonar signal characteristics.
Target column: Categorical variable with two classes, 'R' for rocks and 'M' for mines.

Project Structure
README.md: Documentation of the project.
Rock vs Mine.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
requirements.txt: List of Python packages and dependencies.
data/: Directory containing the Sonar dataset in CSV format.
models/: Directory to save trained machine learning models.

Setup
Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd rock-vs-mine-sonar-classification

Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install the required dependencies:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Notebook
You can run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the project, build and evaluate the classification model.
jupyter notebook Rock vs Mine.ipynb

Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, build and train the model, and evaluate its performance.

Model Training
The project uses a machine learning classification model to classify sonar signals into two classes: rocks and mines. The model is saved in the models/ directory.

Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The evaluation results are presented in the Jupyter Notebook.

Results
The project achieves an accuracy of X% and an F1-score of Y% on the test set.

Future Improvements
There are several ways to improve the model and the project:

Explore more advanced machine learning techniques.
Fine-tune hyperparameters.
Gather more labeled data for better model performance.
